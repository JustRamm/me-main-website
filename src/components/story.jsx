            Mind Empowered (ME) is a charitable organization based in India.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is the brainchild of Maya Menon and her sister - two sisters who
            resonate positivity and happiness wherever they go. During the
            lockdown period, the sisters started conducting free online classes
            on Spoken English and Interview Skills for college students across
            India.
            <br />
            Through close association with students, they realized Gen-Z was
            grappling with Anxiety, Sexual abuse, Depression, Mood swings, Fear,{" "}
            Anger, Loneliness, Low self-esteem, Body shaming, Cyberbullying,{" "}
            Stress, Substance addiction. Many were experiencing Insomnia Eating
            disorders, Domestic violence, Social seclusion and Suicidal
            thoughts. Personality disorders facing myriad mental health issues
            in ways they never did before.
            <br />
            The sisters realized there was a strong need to eliminate stigma
            associated with mental illness from our society. Hence, the idea of
            an open forum to help the students came to life by forming "ME". ME
            started off in October 2020 on World Mental Health Day, with
            enriching and inspiring online sessions for the youth conducted by
            our expert Empowering Coaches, completely free of charge. ME
            reiterates, "Don't Suffer in Silence. Let's talk About Mental
            Health".
